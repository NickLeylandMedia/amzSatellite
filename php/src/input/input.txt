CPM	B003U0583G	Yak Attack Visicarbon Pro Mighty Mount and Geartrac Ready Light - CPM	Designed to meet the needs of all anglers- from serious kayak fishermen to recreational paddlers- the VISICarbon Pro exhibits unprecedented performance in light weight, low drag, and portability- all with plenty of style. The ultra-thin mast and instantly recognizable flag combine to offer excellent performance with low wind resistance, and enhances your visibility on the water, night and day. The VISICarbon Pro light is complete with an LED module, which will burn for 100 hours on 3 AA batteries (included) and provides 360 visibility. The Silent Snap flag attachment provides a secure fastening that can be left for hours, or removed in seconds.

MPJ56M	B01N9XGEIF	Maxel Platinum Medium Action 5'6" 30-50lb Braided Test Jigging Rod MPJ56M	Maxel Platinum Jigging Casting Rods make Japanese-style jigging affordable for the masses. For almost a decade, anglers have been overpaying for this style of fishing rod. That all ends now. The Maxel Platinum offers the same technology at a much better price. For the past five years they have worked to perfect the actions on their 100% carbon fiber blanks. They feature integrated multi-directional layering for incredible lifting and fighting power in a slim profile design. Maxel has outfitted them with Fuji alconite K frame guides that are designed for fishing braid, contoured EVA fore and rear grips that are incredibly comfortable and Fuji graphite palming reel seats. Every rod has a gimbal and comes with a protective vinyl case. If you're looking for a new jigging rod, a Maxel Platinum Jigging Casting Rod should be at the top of your list. Just because a jigging rod is twice as expensive doesn't mean that it is twice as good. It just means that you have half as much money left to spend on a reel. Maxel Platinum Jigging Casting Rods are black. They come with a 3-year manufacturer warranty.	229.99	Active	229.0	229.99

It was one of the first rod holders on the market to look different and function differently with no moving parts on the body of the rod holder and used the specific geometry of spinning and casting rods and reels to lock your gear in place without having to move or secure rotating collars or straps. The new and improved Zooka II features the highly popular LockNLoad Mounting System and includes a 4&#34; extension similar to the Omega Pro Rod Holder. Compared to the original Zooka Tube, we have altered the size and geometry of the Zooka II Rod Holder to better accept larger conventional gear and will accommodate just about any rod other than a fly rod. For everyone that enjoyed using the old Zooka Tube or even currently uses it this one is for you and we know you will enjoy the updated, improved, and more secure YakAttack Zooka II Rod Holder.<br>The Zooka II attaches to your kayak, boat, or other watercraft with YakAttack s brand new LockNLoad mounting system, and is exactly what you would expect from the leader in track mounting technology. Offering unrivaled track mount security and adjustability, the patent pending LockNLoad track base is the most advanced track mount ever created. You want no slip? No problem. The LockNLoad track base attaches quickly and easily with a single MightyBolt, but will not accidentally rotate or loosen from the track, even when your trolling rod takes a big hit.<br>This piece of mechanical brilliance is sure to make the LockNLoad the preferred mounting system of kayak anglers for 2018. Compatible with YakAttack MightyMount s, GearTrac, and most other kayak track systems from Scotty Fishing Products, RAM Mounts, and YakGear. For FeelFree Kayaks, 3 Water Kayaks, and Jonny Boats you will need an adapter to be compatible. We offer the needed adapter in a single pack (AAP-1012) and a six pack (AAP-1012-6).<br>GearTrac not in	41.95	Active

TRS106MA	B08598PKGT	Shimano TIRALEJO SURF 106 M	The new Shimano Tiralejo Surf Spinning Rods are made with the all new Shimano C4S blank construction which utilizes high modulus blank and wraps 4 outer layers of 90 degree graphite. The C4S construction is a unique design that uses Carbon "C" a 4 layer process "4" and slit carbon tape "S" while using high modulus carbon "HM". THe rod is wrapped with an inner and outer layer of carbon tape over two layers of carbon pre-preg. This design significantly increases the strength of the rod but more importantly increases the recovery rate which in turn allows you to cast farther and more accurately as it helps eliminate blank twist when put under a heavy load. This new rod construction will increase the hoop strength for maximum pulling power without inhibiting the sensitivity.	319.98	Active	319.0	319.99

TSAWESS-1102H	B00FCCVCQC	Tsunami Airwave Elite Spin Fishing Rod 2 Pc 11' 20-40 Lb TSAWESS-1102H	Surfcasting is usually a distance game with longer casts often required to reach prime territory. The Tsunami Elite Series surf rod selection has been designed to achieve maximum distance performance with the least amount of physical effort !

VR50	B079VRB13R	Van Staal VR50 Spinning Reel | Silver	The second generation of Van Staal VR Spinning Reels are the surf angler's dream come true! These fully sealed, fully submergeable reels are the brain child of Rob Koelewyn, the original creator of Van Staal. They are constructed of aluminum with a solid titanium spool shaft. They have a powerful, waterproof drag system and a lightweight design. They come from the factory with a bail and a bailless conversion kit so you can fish them however you like. Van Staal has cut the weight of the reel as much as possible by not only adding cut outs on the body, rotor and spool, but also using a delrin ball knob that is very strong and makes the handle virtually weightless. What's left is an amazingly well balanced reel that is ready to go to battle with you the next time you hit the beach. The second generation upgrades include a thicker gear on the 50/75 sizes. The 125-200 have gotten a much thicker stainless steel shaft and the same great waterproof drag you find in the VS X-SERIES reels. Another awesome feature of the Van Staal VR Series is the price point.	519.94	Active	519.0	519.99

BV-500L-SBL	B07LFJQDQM	Accurate Valiant 500 Series Conventional Reel	The Accurate Boss Valiant Reels are baitcasting reels that come in both single speed and 2-speed models. They are designed for inshore and light action offshore applications. These reels are made with innovative design that minimizes size and weight while maximizing strength, longevity and fish fighting power. These reels were built with shallow water jigging in mind, but they can also be used for live-bait coastal fishing, snapper fishing around reefs, jigging for silver salmon, or targeting school-sized tuna, yellowtail and dorado. The unique curvature of the BV-300’s rugged body gives this compact, extremely lightweight reel the structural integrity of models twice its size. Basing the BV-300’s design on the original premise of the Roman Arches or Domes used in early architecture, Accurate has been able to create a significantly stronger reel using less material. While the BV-300’s walls are thinner, its non-flexing frame and side plate enable it to withstand more stress than similarly sized reels. Accurate has also managed to fit the drive train of a bigger reel perfectly into the BV-300’s small profile. These Boss Valiant Reels also incorporate a new Accurate feature – an easy-find “Cam Stop” at strike. Instead of having buttons at free spool and strike, these reels have a secure indent in the Drag Cam that stops the drag lever before going into full. This useful feature offers a fail-safe during the heat of battle, preventing the angler from going too far into full drag.	499.95	Inactive	499.95	499.95

DTX140-F-HGS	B07X9VWGMY	Nomad Design DTX Minnow Floating | Pat. Pending Autotune Technology (HGS - Holo Ghost Shad, 5.5" Floating - 30ft Diver - 1.75oz)	Deep, fast, straight – guaranteed. The DTX Minnow has raised the bar in trolling minnow performance and features the pat. pending Autotune system. Developed over years of R&D the Autotune system gives the lure the ability to perfectly center itself at the tow point delivering 3 key benefits, the ability to ensure the lure always swims straight, increasing diving depth and increased troll speed. This combination makes it unique in the world of offshore trolling minnows. A self centering tow point ensures that no matter how many fish you catch, the lure will keep swimming straight. Conventional lures with a fixed towpoint cannot all be made perfectly centered to swim straight. The ability of the Autotune system to perfectly center itself every time on the bib means that the tow point can be pushed as far back on the bib as possible, meaning maximum diving depth and better action combined with higher troll speeds. Available in 3 offshore sizes, 2 inshore sizes and 2 inshore/estuary/freshwater sizes, there is a DTX minnow for every application. Other key features of the DTX range include: Hydrospeed belly eyelet for maximum trolling speed; HD ABS System, an extra strong white plastic for overall strength and durability; Diamond Armour internal mesh system, strengthening transparent colors not using HD ABS; Gorilla Through Wire, welded and supported for extra strength; Metal Matrix Plate, stainless steel plate system (DTX220LRS only); heavy duty BKK hooks and terminals. The concealed Hydrospeed belly eyelet allows faster trolling speeds with single hooks, and ensures the lure is balanced with single hooks, so the DTX minnow keeps swimming straight and true. The additional belly eyelet in front of the Hydrospeed eyelet is designed to be able to fit an assist hook when targeting large tuna and marlin.	24.99	Inactive

Its 5:1 gear ratio combined with the torque it generates will allow you to reel in big fish. It's also a great casting reel!

RHM-1001	B078PL9DW8	YakAttack Omega Rod Holder with LockNLoad Track Mount (Track Sold Separately)	The slogan for our new Omega series rod holders is The last rod holder you ll ever need and that s exactly what we have developed. This is a truly universal solution that works flawlessly with spinning, casting, larger conventional reels, and yes even fly rods of all sizes. A 360 degree rotating collar offers the ability to quickly secure the rod by capturing the reel, and allows spinning reels to be stowed in the natural downward position, not hung off the side. Multiple modes allow anglers to easily stage rods for quick access or lock them in for maximum security.<br><br>The Omega Rod Holder attaches to your kayak, boat, or other watercraft with YakAttack s brand new LockNLoad mounting system, and is exactly what you would expect from the leader in track mounting technology. Offering unrivaled track mount security and adjustability, the patent pending LockNLoad track base is the most advanced track mount ever created. You want no slip? No problem. The LockNLoad track base attaches quickly and easily with a single MightyBolt, but will not accidentally rotate or loosen from the track, even when your trolling rod takes a big hit. Compatible with YakAttack MightyMount s, GearTrac, and most other kayak track systems from Scotty Fishing Products, RAM Mounts, and YakGear. For FeelFree Kayaks, 3 Water Kayaks, and Jonny Boats you will need an adapter to be compatible. We offer the needed adapter in a single pack (AAP-1012) and a six pack (AAP-1012-6).<br>There are 3 modes: locked, adjustment, and removal. The patent pending design is easy to use:<br><br>- From locked mode, simply squeeze a lever to go into adjustment mode.<br>- In adjustment mode, the mount can be rotated in any direction, but cannot be removed, ensuring the rod holder is completely secure while making adjustments, even if a fish hits. Let go of the lever and you back in locked mode.<br>- To go to removal mode, flip the lever out, and the system easily slides off of the track mount.<br><br>This	29.95	Inactive

V2FM+FPG	B01KMH9I5I	YakAttack VISIPole II GearTrac Ready Light with Flag (V2FM+FPG)	Light on 3/8&#34; Fiberglass mast with a floating base. Manufactured from domestically manufactured 3/8&#34; fiberglass tube. Permanently attached to the light and the base. With a height of 4'-6&#34; tall, you will truly be visible from 360 degrees. In situations where a 360 degree white light is not necessary or required, the flag can be slid over the light, creating a soft glow that is less likely to attract bugs or spook fish, while maintaining some level of visibility to others around you. This technique is not recommended for environments in which powered craft may be present. Compatible with YakAttack MightyMount s, GearTrac, and most other kayak track systems from Scotty Fishing Products, RAM Mounts, and YakGear. For FeelFree Kayaks, 3 Water Kayaks, and Jonny Boats you will need an adapter to be compatible. We offer the needed adapter in a single pack (AAP-1012) and a six pack (AAP-1012-6).<br>Light on 3/8&#34; Fiberglass mast<br>3 AA batteries<br>LEDs burn 100 hours on 3 AA batteries (included)<br>10,000+ hours lamp life<br>3/8&#34; fiberglass tube<br>Waterproof to a depth of 1000 feet<br>Orange flag<br>Compatible with MightyMount and GearTrac<br>Made in the USA<br>Covered by a Built for Life Guarantee<br>SKU: V2FM-FPG<br>	74.95	Inactive
